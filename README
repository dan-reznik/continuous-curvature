- A mathematica notebook shows for calculating a plane curve with continuous curvature.
- The curvature profile is piecewise parabolic (3 parabolic segments).
- The plane curve is computed in two steps:

(1) obtaining the angle function as a definite integral from the profile, in closed-form.
(2) obtaining the curve itself by numerically integrating the cosine and sine of the curvatures.

The animation shows the resulting curve with the angular integral (1) scaled by a factor "a" which is varied from 0 to 2 in the animation, for curve length s = 0 to 4.
Points at s=0,1,3,4 are drawn on curve.
Curiously, with a slightly above 1, the curve seems to become "closed" (returns to its starting location).
